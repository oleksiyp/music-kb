# Clear Music Theory (PTM-24) - Full Lecture Series

This music theory course, developed for the Australian Institute of Music and recommended by the Ministry of Education, explains applied music theory from golden sequences to divine dissonances. It covers concepts like scales, modes, and harmonization techniques. The course emphasizes understanding the difference between a sound row, a mode, and a scale, defining a sound row as a collection of unrelated sounds, and a mode as a system of stable and unstable sounds with hierarchical relationships. The speaker also introduces the concept of the circle of fifths as a crucial tool for harmonizing and composing, likening it to a calculator for complex musical tasks. The course concludes with a modal approach to chord progressions, using a "modal dial" concept for ease of implementation, aiming to provide practical tools for composers rather than just theoretical understanding. The creator thanks various individuals, including family, teachers, and other musicians, for their inspiration and support in creating the course.

# The Circle of Fifths for Songwriting

This video, "The Circle of Fifths for Songwriting", explains how the Circle of Fifths can be used for songwriting.

The video demonstrates how to transform a chord progression into a completely different sound using modes within the Circle of Fifths. Using the example of the Pachelbel progression, it's shown how a major key progression can be shifted into a minor key, specifically the Aeolian mode, to create a different mood or feeling. This technique allows for unexpected musical outcomes and can be applied in any key with any of the modes in the Circle of Fifths.
