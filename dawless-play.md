## How to Make a Salsa Beat | Korg Volca Sample Tutorial

This video is a tutorial on creating a salsa percussion rhythm using the Korg Volca Sample, though the techniques can be applied to other samplers or DAWs. The creator, inspired by salsa music after getting married in Colombia, demonstrates how to build the beat layer by layer.

The tutorial covers:

 - Setting up the pattern by adjusting tempo and swing.
 - Adding instruments in sequence, including a tambourine, cowbell, high-pitched bongo, high-pitched conga, low-pitched conga, timbale, triangle, and clave.
 - Adjusting parameters for each instrument like volume, pitch, and panning to create a dynamic and wide stereo sound.
 - Strategic placement of sounds on different steps to build the intricate salsa rhythm.
 - The video also includes a quick plug for the creator's PDF of 25 drum patterns, available on Patreon. The tutorial concludes with a demonstration of the finished salsa beat integrated with other salsa instrumentals.
