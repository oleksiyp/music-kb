## Rhytmic singing

This video offers advice for vocalists aiming to enhance their rhythmic singing. It emphasizes that true rhythmic accuracy involves precise note starts and ends, along with clear articulations.

The video draws a comparison to guitarists, who use rhythmic increments for precision.
For singers, the solution is using consonants as "percussion" within the vocal line.
The suggested exercise includes:

Temporarily setting aside emotional delivery.
Vocalizing "taka-taka-taka" with the melody's notes, maintaining a clear rhythm.
Adding dynamic variations (loud/soft) to this exercise, mimicking a drum part.
Practicing the song's words, aligning consonants and note durations with this internal rhythm.
This training aims to improve the brain's alignment of articulation with rhythm, enhancing note precision and the vocal performance's groove. The technique focuses on developing internal rhythmic precision, applicable across musical genres.
