That's a great mix of tools---you're covering **ear training, rhythm, piano playing, and singing**. The best practice strategy depends on your goals and available time, but here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each approach:

### âœ… **Best Recommendation: "Rotate focus weekly + daily minimums"**

> Combine a **daily minimum habit** with a **weekly focus**, like this:

#### **Structure:**

-   **Daily minimums**:\
    Spend **15 minutes/day** on 2--3 disciplines (not all 4 every day), to build consistency.

-   **Weekly focus**:\
    Each **week**, choose **one discipline** to give **extra attention** (e.g., 3--4 sessions of 30--45 min).

#### Example Week:

| Day | Activity (15--30 min) | Focus Area (Extra) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | EarMaster + Melodics | Ear Training (extra 20 min) |
| Tuesday | Melodics + Yousician | Piano |
| Wednesday | EarMaster (rhythm only) + Yousician | Singing |
| Thursday | Melodics only (longer session) | Rhythm/Piano |
| Friday | EarMaster + Yousician | Ear |
| Saturday | Catch-up + fun improv | Free/creative |
| Sunday | REST or review highlights | Recovery |

### ðŸ§  Why "Weekly Focus + Daily Minimum" Works

-   **Habit-forming**: 15 min/day is manageable and builds discipline.

-   **Deep work**: The weekly focus lets you improve one area noticeably.

-   **Spacing effect**: Skills benefit from being revisited 2--3Ã— a week (vs. once per week or month).

-   **Flexibility**: You can rebalance based on your energy, interest, or weakness.

### Bonus Tips

-   Use **Melodics + EarMaster** in **tandem**: Rhythm + ear help each other.

-   Track your mood and fatigue: singing or piano might suit certain times of day.

-   Once a month, record yourself for fun (even if rough)---it helps track progress.
