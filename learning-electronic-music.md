🌟 Personalized Music Theory Program for Kinesthetic Learners
Focus: learn through doing, playing, singing, DAW interaction, and physical memoryLevel: beginner / self-taughtRequirements: MIDI keyboard (or synthesizer), voice, DAW (Ableton, LMMS), EarMaster or similar

🔄 Format: 5 days a week, 20–40 minutes per session
Each lesson includes:
"Topic of the day" (1 core music theory concept)
"Hands-on activity" (playing, singing, building)
"Sound check" (in DAW or by ear)
"Reflection" (1–2 sentences: what you felt, heard, or understood)

🗓️ Week 1 — Sound and Intervals Fundamentals
Day 1: Notes and Intervals by Ear
🎯 Topic: what is a note, scale degree, interval
🎹 Activity: play 5 intervals on the keyboard: unison, third, fourth, fifth, octave
🎤 Sing each one: “C — E”, “A — D”, etc.
🎧 Compare in EarMaster or your DAW (visual and auditory)
Day 2: Intervals on Keyboard
🎯 Topic: distances between notes — semitone vs whole tone
👐 Use your fingers: find major and minor intervals physically
📊 Draw on paper: “C — E” equals two tones → major third
Day 3: Scales
🎯 Topic: major and minor — stepwise ladders
🎹 Play the C major and A minor scales
🎤 Sing each: DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO
🎧 Build a scale in a DAW MIDI clip
Day 4: Rhythm
🎯 Topic: durations, meter, strong beats
👋 Clap 4/4: "one-two-three-four" — alternate strong/weak beats
🥈 Build a simple rhythm loop in your DAW
🎤 Speak rhythms with metronome: “ta-ti-ti-ta”
Day 5: Mini Composition
🎯 Topic: 3 chords, melody, and rhythm
🎹 Build C — Am — F (or Gm — Dm — Cm)
🎤 Improvise/sing a phrase over them
🎧 Record in DAW — listen and evaluate

🗓️ Week 2 — Chords, Modes, and Tonality
Day 6: Building Triads
🎯 Topic: major and minor chords (triads)
🎹 Play C, Am, G, Dm on your keyboard
🎤 Sing each as arpeggios: “C-E-G”
📊 Draw the intervals between notes on paper
Day 7: Key and Scale
🎯 Topic: how to identify a melody's key
🎧 Use a short loop — try to identify its scale
🎹 Play potential chords within that key
📝 Write down what fits and what doesn’t
Day 8: Parallel Tonalities
🎯 Topic: major ↔ minor (e.g. C and Am)
🎹 Play both scales — compare their character
🎤 Try to sing and play the same melody in both keys
🎧 Analyze what changes by ear
Day 9: Learning Melody by Ear
🎯 Topic: finding song notes
🎧 Play a simple familiar melody (folk or children's song)
🎹 Find it note by note, write in MIDI or on paper
🎤 Sing the phrases you found, find and fix errors
Day 10: Harmonizing a Melody
🎯 Topic: chords under a melody
🎧 Use the melody from Day 9
🎹 Choose 2–3 supporting chords to match
🎤 Sing over the harmony and record in DAW

📒 Week 3 — Melody, Structure, and Harmony
Day 11: Phrase Structure
🎯 Topic: musical sentences and phrasing
🎹 Play short 4-bar melodic ideas and pause naturally
🎤 Sing phrases with breath marks — notice symmetry
🎧 Record and compare 2 versions: one with clear phrasing, one without
Day 12: Question and Answer
🎯 Topic: call and response in melody
🎹 Create a "question" phrase on the keyboard (ends unresolved)
🎹 Answer it with a resolving phrase
🎤 Sing both, check that it feels "complete"
Day 13: Cadences and Resolution
🎯 Topic: ending phrases with closure
🎹 Play V → I (G to C, A7 to Dm, etc.) in different keys
🎤 Sing resolutions on "la" or "do"
🎧 Build a short loop and add cadence at the end
Day 14: Harmony Progressions
🎯 Topic: common chord movements (I-IV-V, ii-V-I)
🎹 Play each in at least two keys
🎤 Improvise simple melodies above them
🎧 Record in DAW and evaluate feel/mood
Day 15: Full Song Sketch
🎯 Topic: creating musical form
🎹 Arrange intro, verse, chorus (use loops or played parts)
🎤 Sing or play lead melody
🎧 Record and reflect: does it flow? Where does it repea
