# Personalized Music Theory Program for Kinesthetic Learners

**Focus:** Learn through doing, playing, singing, DAW interaction, and physical memory  
**Level:** Beginner / self-taught  
**Requirements:** MIDI keyboard (or synthesizer), voice, DAW (Ableton, LMMS), EarMaster or similar

## Format
**Schedule:** 5 days a week, 20–40 minutes per session

Each lesson includes:
- **"Topic of the day"** (1 core music theory concept)
- **"Hands-on activity"** (playing, singing, building)
- **"Sound check"** (in DAW or by ear)
- **"Reflection"** (1–2 sentences: what you felt, heard, or understood)

## Week 1 — Sound and Intervals Fundamentals

### Day 1: Notes and Intervals by Ear
- **🎯 Topic:** What is a note, scale degree, interval
- **🎹 Activity:** Play 5 intervals on the keyboard: unison, third, fourth, fifth, octave
- **🎤 Sing:** Each one: "C — E", "A — D", etc.
- **🎧 Compare:** In EarMaster or your DAW (visual and auditory)

### Day 2: Intervals on Keyboard
- **🎯 Topic:** Distances between notes — semitone vs whole tone
- **👐 Use your fingers:** Find major and minor intervals physically
- **📊 Draw on paper:** "C — E" equals two tones → major third

### Day 3: Scales
- **🎯 Topic:** Major and minor — stepwise ladders
- **🎹 Play:** The C major and A minor scales
- **🎤 Sing:** Each: DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO
- **🎧 Build:** A scale in a DAW MIDI clip

- **🎯 Topic:** Durations, meter, strong beats
- **👋 Clap:** 4/4: "one-two-three-four" — alternate strong/weak beats
- **🥈 Build:** A simple rhythm loop in your DAW
- **🎤 Speak:** Rhythms with metronome: "ta-ti-ti-ta"

### Day 5: Mini Composition
- **🎯 Topic:** 3 chords, melody, and rhythm
- **🎹 Build:** C — Am — F (or Gm — Dm — Cm)

- **🎹 Play:** C, Am, G, Dm on your keyboard
- **🎤 Sing:** Each as arpeggios: "C-E-G"
- **📊 Draw:** The intervals between notes on paper

### Day 7: Key and Scale
- **🎯 Topic:** How to identify a melody's key
- **🎧 Use:** A short loop — try to identify its scale
- **🎹 Play:** Potential chords within that key
- **📝 Write:** Down what fits and what doesn't

### Day 8: Parallel Tonalities
- **🎯 Topic:** Major ↔ minor (e.g. C and Am)
- **🎹 Play:** Both scales — compare their character
- **🎤 Try:** To sing and play the same melody in both keys
- **🎧 Analyze:** What changes by ear

### Day 9: Learning Melody by Ear
- **🎯 Topic:** Finding song notes
- **🎧 Play:** A simple familiar melody (folk or children's song)
- **🎹 Find:** It note by note, write in MIDI or on paper
- **🎤 Sing:** The phrases you found, find and fix errors

### Day 10: Harmonizing a Melody
- **🎯 Topic:** Chords under a melody
- **🎧 Use:** The melody from Day 9
- **🎹 Choose:** 2–3 supporting chords to match

- **🎹 Play:** Each in at least two keys
- **🎤 Improvise:** Simple melodies above them
- **🎧 Record:** In DAW and evaluate feel/mood

### Day 15: Full Song Sketch
