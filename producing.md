# A Simple Rhythmic Trick For Instant Groove

This video, "A Simple Rhythmic Trick For Instant Groove," by Cableguys, demonstrates how using **dotted eighth notes** (an eighth note plus a sixteenth note) can add funk and groove to your music.

The video highlights four ways to apply this trick:
* **Draw MIDI based on repeating patterns of three sixteenths**.
* **For drums, embellish a basic quarter or eighth pattern with quieter hits offset by a dotted eighth note**.
* **Use dotted eighth note LFOs in synths and effects**, such as chopping pads with a dotted eighth note rhythm to create a hypnotic effect against a quarter-note kit.
* **Apply dotted eighth note delays to add counter-rhythms** to vocals, melodies, percussion, or other elements.
